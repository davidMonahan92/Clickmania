A Reaction-Tester-Game to test the limits of your quickness!

Click the random shapes as quick as you can and check out your quickest clicks in the results table.

Details on this project:
  - Coded purely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - Records the time taken to click the shape
  - The shapes are totally random and have random colours too
  - The shapes only appear in the square arena
  - All results get pushed to an array, which is then sliced and sorted with the lowest times first
  - Press the Get Best Times button to display the top 10 times to the results table
  - The times will change everytime you press the button BUT only if you bet your own best times
